We want to fit the straight line for the data points in logit vs variable plot in such a way that it explains (correctly separates) the maximum number of data points when it gets converted to the blue squiggly line through inverse-logit (aka logistic function). So to achieve the best regression, a similar strategy of simple linear regression comes into play but despite minimizing the squared residual, the idea is to maximize the likelihood . Since the points scattered on the infinity make it difficult to proceed in an orthodox linear regression method, the trick is to project these points on the logit (the initial chosen/fitted line with the arbitrary coefficient)
